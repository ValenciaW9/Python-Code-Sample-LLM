## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the OpenAI library. You can install the OpenAI package using pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

## Usage

1. Set your OpenAI API key in the code by replacing `'your-openai-api-key'` with your actual API key. **Note:** It's recommended to keep your API key secure and not expose it in public repositories.

2. Run the script. It will demonstrate summarization, classification, and response generation.

```bash
python openai_text_processing.py
```

## Functions

### `summarize_text(text)`

Summarizes the given text using the OpenAI language model. 

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): The text to summarize.

**Returns:**
- (str): The summarized text.

### `classify_text(text)`

Classifies the topic of the input text into one of the specified categories: 'Technology', 'Health', 'Education', 'Finance', or 'Entertainment'.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): The text to classify.

**Returns:**
- (str): The classified category.

### `generate_response(prompt)`

**Parameters:**
- `prompt` (str): The user input for which a response is needed.

**Returns:**
- (str): The AI-generated response.

## Example

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example text to summarize and classify
    sample_text = """
    Artificial intelligence is transforming the world in many fields such as healthcare, finance, and education. 
    AI is used to predict diseases, automate trading, and provide personalized learning experiences.
    """
    
    # Summarize the text
    summary = summarize_text(sample_text)
    print(f"Summary:\n{summary}\n")
    
    # Classify the text
    category = classify_text(sample_text)
    print(f"Classified Category: {category}\n")
    
    # Generate a conversational response
    user_input = "What are the latest advancements in AI?"
    ai_response = generate_response(user_input)
    print(f"AI Response:\n{ai_response}\n")
```
